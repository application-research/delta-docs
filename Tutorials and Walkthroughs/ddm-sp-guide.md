# Delta Dataset Manager: Getting Started

Interested in setting up Delta Dataset Manager as a Data Preparer/Onboarder? Follow this guide!

This guide will walkthrough the set-up of Delta and DDM in a standalone deployment, then show you how to add a dataset, content, wallets, SPs, and finally create replications.


## Installation

### Prerequisites
- The following should work on macOS, as well as any Linux distro 
- Prerequisites: Go v1.19+, Rust v1.65+ OR Docker/Docker Compose
- Minimal CPU/RAM/Disk - this is a very lightweight application and should be able to run on a small VM

### Install (Baremetal)
Follow the instructions in the quick-start section in [Delta Standalone Repository](https://github.com/application-research/delta-standalone#quick-start)

Set-up can be done in a few minutes with just a single command. 

Follow the instructions as indicated and save your Delta API key.


### Install (Docker Compose)
Coming soon!


## Set-up

### 0. Verify Installation
Verify that the set-up was successful by running the following command:

```bash
ps -aux | grep delta
```

You should see **three** Delta processes running: `delta`, `delta-dm` and `node` (for NextJS/React Frontend) 

```shell
root     1980744  0.0  0.0   6244  2408 pts/11   S+   22:57   0:00 grep delta
root     3860935  9.9  0.1 11331296 2095992 ?    Sl   Apr07 605:54 ./delta/delta daemon --mode=standalone
root     3861546  0.0  0.0 2869124 30644 ?       Sl   Apr07   0:39 ./delta-dm/delta-dm daemon
root     3861647  0.0  0.0 11156624 56728 ?      Sl   Apr07   0:06 node ./delta-standalone/delta-nextjs-client/node_modules/.bin/next
```

Verify that you can access to the DDM UI by visiting `http://localhost:3000` on the server where you installed Delta.

Paste in the Delta API key, and specify the URL where Delta-DM is running (same server, default port is 1314).

Source `delta.env` to set the environment variables if you'd like to use the CLI.


### 1. Create a Dataset

**By UI**

Create a dataset by clicking on the `+ New Dataset` button on the top left corner of the DDM UI.
Fill in the details of the dataset and click `Create Dataset`.

**By CLI**
```bash
./delta-dm dataset add --name radiant-earth-ml --replication-quota 6 --duration 540 --unsealed true --indexed true
```


### 2. Add wallet 
**By CLI**
Wallets must be added via the DDM CLI for security reasons.

```bash
# (On a machine where a wallet is accessible in Lotus)
> ./delta-dm wallet import --hex $(lotus wallet export f1mmb3lx7lnzkwsvhridvpugnuzo4mq2xjmawvnfi)
```

### 2a. Associate wallet with dataset
**By UI**
Find the wallet in the DDM UI, and click the **Associate With Dataset** button below it.

Select the dataset you added previously, and click **Apply**

<img src="../assets/ddm-associate-wallet.png" width=400/>

**By CLI**
```bash
./delta-dm wallet associate --address f1mmb3lx7lnzkwsvhridvpugnuzo4mq2xjmawvnfi --dataset radiant-earth-ml 
```

### 3. Add Content to Dataset
There are a number of ways to associate content with a dataset.

Note: Piece CIDs / CommP's must be globally unique in DDM - thus, you don't have to worry about collisions when importing content from other CAR generation tools - the duplicates will simply not be added. This allows you to progressively import content from those tools as they are generated, without needing to "diff" the CID list.

#### Importing from other CAR generation tooling
**Singularity Content**
Follow the instructions in the [Singularity Import Guide](https://github.com/application-research/delta-dm/blob/main/docs/singularity-import.md))

**Ptolemy Content**
Follow the instructions in [Ptolemy Import Guide](https://github.com/application-research/delta-dm/blob/main/docs/ptolemy-import.md)

#### Importing from CSV/JSON file
**By UI**
Click on the `Datasets` button on the top left corner of the DDM UI. Click the `Attach Content` button below the dataset you created previously. 

<img src="../assets/ddm-attach-content-button.png" width=300/>

After that, you can either click Attach Content or drag and drop the file into the UI.

JSON Format: Consult the [DDM Format](https://github.com/application-research/delta-dm/blob/main/docs/api.md#delta-dm-format) spec for a description of the JSON schema you need to follow. 

**By CLI**
```bash
# json file
./delta-dm content import --dataset radiant-earth-ml --json ./content.json

# OR csv file
./delta-dm content import --dataset radiant-earth-ml --csv ./content.csv
```


### 4. Add Provider(s)
**By UI**
Click on the `+ Add Provider` button on the top left corner of the DDM UI. Enter the SP's address (f0######), and an optional friendly name.

<img src="../assets/ddm-add-provider.png" width=400/>

**By CLI**
```bash
./delta-dm provider add --address f011111 --name "My Provider"
```

### 4a. Associate Provider with datasett

**By UI**
From the **Providers** pane, click the **Manage [SP ID]** button. Under the **Allowed Datasets** section, click **Add**, select the dataset you created previously, and click **Apply**.

**By CLI**
> optionally, enable self-service
```bash
./delta-dm provider modify --id f011111 --allowed-datasets radiant-earth-ml --allow-self-service on
```

### 5. Create Replications!

**By UI**
Click the **Add Replication** button in the top left-hand corner of the DDM UI. Select the provider, and (optionally) select a dataset to replicate. Choose the number of deals, days to delay start epoch, and then click **Add**.

<img src="../assets/ddm-add-replication.png" width=400/>

Wait a few seconds - the deal(s) will be made with the provider and show up in the DDM Replications tab.

**By CLI**
```bash
./delta-dm replication create --provider f011111 --num 1 --dataset radiant-earth-ml --delay-start 7
```

**By SP Pulling deal (Self-Service)**
First, enable self-service for the provider by visiting the **Providers** tab, and clicking **Edit**, and checking the **Allow Self Service** checkbox. Securely share the **Provider Key** with the SP, as they'll use this to request deals from DDM.

<img src="../assets/ddm-allow-ss.png" width=400/>

In order to make a deal request, your ddm API (i.e, `http://localhost:1314/api/v2/self-service`) must be reachable by them. To set easily set this up, we recommend configuring a reverse proxy like [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) or [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/).

Check out [Delta Importer](https://github.com/application-research/delta-importer), which can be configured in either **Pull Dataset** or **Pull CID** mode to automatically pull deals from DDM. 

For an SP to manually make a request for a deal, share the following **cURL** command with them, as an example:

```bash
# Pull a deal for a specific dataset
curl --request GET \
  --url 'http://your-delta-dm-address-here/api/v1/self-service/by-dataset/dataset-name?start_epoch_delay=3' \
  --header 'X-DELTA-AUTH: xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx'

# Pull a deal for a specific CID
curl --request GET \
  --url 'http://your-delta-dm-address-here/api/v1/self-service/by-cid/cid?start_epoch_delay=3' \
  --header 'X-DELTA-AUTH: xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx'
```

For more information on the API, see the [DDM Self-Service documentation](https://github.com/application-research/delta-dm/blob/main/docs/self-service.md)
